# Walk-likelihood methods 
We present two novel algorithms for partitioning a network with symmetric edges (both weighted and unweighted) into non-overlapping communities. 
1. Walk-likelihood algorithm (WLA): WLA produces an optimal partition of network nodes into a given number of communities.
2. Walk-likelihood community finder (WLCF): WLCF predicts the optimal number of network communities mopt using global moves that involve bifurcation and merging of communities and employs WLA to refine node community assignments at each step.

# Usage

```
class walk_likelihood:

The methods WLA and WLCF are implemented as functions in the class walk_likelihood defined in the file walk_likelihood.py.
